A simple Twitter-like fullstack app built on the MERN (MondoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJs) stack, as well as Redux as the app's state container.

JWT (JSON Web tokens) is used to handle user authentication.

## Getting started

In the root directory, run `yarn` and `yarn frontend-install` to install dependencies, then `yarn dev` to start up both backend and frontend in development mode.
