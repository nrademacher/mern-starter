# MERN starter

A complete MERN (MondoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJs) template for getting started with building a fullstack app.

Includes JWT user authorization as well as basic RESTful CRUD functionality to build upon.

## Getting started

1. Add your MongoDB connection string and a secret/key string for JWT in `.env.example`, then remove the `.example` extension.
2. In the root directory, run `yarn` and `yarn frontend-install` to install the dependencies, then `yarn dev` to start up both backend and frontend in development mode.
